This application utilizes the google-search-results module to query the SerpApi (Google Trends engine) for regional food "Related Queries," using the $cat: 71$ parameter to isolate food-specific spikes. The program then processes the resulting JSON data and uses the requests library to fetch detailed product profiles from the Open Food Facts API. These API calls provide specific data types including the Nutri-Score (alphabetical grade), NOVA group (integer processing level), and Eco-Score (environmental impact). To ensure data quality, the script uses a recursive loop to filter out any results with "unknown" or empty values, only displaying a final analysis once a fully documented product is found.
